    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to perform soem hypothesis tests on the Northwind Database.\n",
    "This is a Microsoft open sorce/free database.\n",

    "Our goal is to formulate hypothesis tests such that we can get some valuable insights for a potential company.\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach for this project has been:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate interesting questions-->In order to get some useful insights\n",
    "2. EDA--> In order to get an understanding of our data summarizing their main characteristics mainly through visualization \n",
    "3. Defining Null and Alternative Hypotheses-->Answer to the research question and guide data collection and interpretation\n",
    "4. Set Alpha level--> I used a alpha level of 0.05 for all my Hypotheses\n",
    "5. Test our Data Set--> Use different tests to understand the p-value\n",
    "6. Check Effect Size--> d cohen's formula\n",
    "7. Obtain valuable Insights--> Give some raccomandations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formulate our Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is it December, considering the Christmas time period in it, the month with the highest revenue?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the revenue of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "5. There is a statistically significant difference in terms of Revenue for different countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. There is statistically significant difference in terms of Revenue between different categories?\n",
